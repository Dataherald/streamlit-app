## Features 🚀

- **Ask your Questions:** 💡 Connect to various databases by providing their connection details and ask any questions that have on top of your mind from Dataherald's powerful NL-to-SQL engine.

- **Add Golden records:** 💎 In order to boost the performance of the engine even higher, add verified Question/SQL pairs. These pairs are going to be used by the agent at inference time.

- **View and Remove Golden records:** 📜 This application provides a user-friendly interface for viewing, searching, and removing Question/SQL pairs to control the agent's behavior.

- **Table Scanning:** 🗃️ Scan tables in connected databases by specifying the table name. Scanned tables are used by the agent to generate answers.

- **Viewing Tables:** 📊 View descriptions and details of tables within connected databases. Understand the structure and number of columns of each table easily.
